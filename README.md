# Diffusion-Reaction-Animations-Notebook
An interactive notebook for creating matplotlib animations of Gray Scott diffusion reaction processes approximated numerically.


[Here's the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bqkH5WEzcrCvBkUeNleejYPliDPLLsnV?usp=sharing). Create a copy of the notebook, specify animation framerate/resolution and play with the Gray Scott variables to create your own animations.

## Gray Scott Equations

<IMG SRC="Images/GrayScott.png">

Gray Scott equations describe the rate of change of two co-dependent populations across time and space, e.g. a population of predators whose success depends on the availability of its prey. In the notebook the diffusion rates of each population can be adjusted as well as the kill and feed rate. <br>
